# 📌 OLED 1306 I2C DISPLAY WITH VSQUADRON FM FPGA


## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) communication protocol using Verilog HDL on the **VSD Squadron Mini** development board to interface with a **0.96-inch SSD1306-based OLED display (128×64 resolution)**. I²C is a widely used serial communication protocol that enables efficient data transfer between digital devices using only two signal lines: Serial Data (SDA) and Serial Clock (SCL).

 As a demonstration, a **world map and the VSD** are rendered on the OLED display. This project serves as a practical example of FPGA-based peripheral interfacing and digital system design, making it suitable for academic learning and hands-on hardware development.

## I2C
The SSD1306 OLED display is commonly used in embedded systems due to its low power consumption, high contrast, and compact form factor. By leveraging the I²C interface, the VSD Squadron Mini can reliably transmit command and display data to the OLED, enabling the rendering of text, symbols, and simple graphics.

The objective of this project is to understand the practical aspects of I²C protocol operation, including device addressing, control byte formatting, and data transmission, while also gaining hands-on experience in driving a graphical display at the register and protocol level. This implementation serves as a foundational step toward more advanced embedded and SoC-based display applications.
